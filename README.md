  ## Description
  With some provided starter code, I was able to create a weather dashboard that shows a 5 day weather forcast utilizing an API through OpenWeather API.  The client side code was previously provided, so I was able to focus on the server side of the application.  This project was a greate introduction towards my learning process of understanding how a full stack application can look like.   Understanding how the server works together with the client was one of the major struggles that I encountered during this project.
